# Cubscout
Cubscout is an application for scouting matches in FIRST Robotics Competition. Scouting is the process of tracking the performance of other robotics teams in their matches in order to make educated decisions. Cubscout focuses on alliance selection, wherin the higher-ranking teams after qualifying rounds choose teams for their alliance of three to compete in the playoffs.

# Motivation
Many teams, ours formerly included, use paper scouting forms and simple spreadsheets for scouting. This is an extremely cumbersome process and locks teams in to tracking what they expected to be important at the time they printed off the scouting sheets. Cubscout aims to allow teams to track detailed information that is important to them and change what information is relevent without losing the progress they made in earlier matches.

Many of the existing scouting solutions did very little actual data processing, instead serving purely as data collection to be later used in a spreadsheet. While this alleviates some of the logistical problems of the conventional paper+Excel method, spreadsheets are not a convienient data processing method, especially when a team wants to change how the data is processed. Cubscout's primary purpose is to do the hard work in processing scouting information while providing the flexibility possible in spreadsheet-based methods.
